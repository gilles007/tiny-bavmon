Power Monitor and Heartbeat watchdog for Birdland Audio's
BAV335x Network Processor Module
(http://birdlandaudio.com/oem/bav335x-network-processor).

The BAV335x Network Processor module utilizes a AT tiny4
micro-controller (U8) to monitor the module's PMIC and this
is the code that runs on U8.

This code provides two options selectable by two startup
boot-strap pins on the BAV335x module. The options are:

1) Always-on monitor. The code monitors the power mode
of the PMIC and if it is off, simulates a user-press on
the PMIC's power button to make sure the BAV335x is always
power on. This is esepcially useful for Ethernet appliances
that must always be on. Also if the operating system shuts
down, then the monitor will kick in and turn the power on
again allowing an appliance to software generate a full
power cycle reboot by simply shutting down.

2) Linux Heartbeat LED watchdog. If the BAV335x module
pin.135 (AT tiny U8 pin.1) is tied to the linux heartbeat
LED (usually BAV335x module pin.57), then U8 will also
act as a watchdog rebooting the system if the heartbeat
is lost for aproximatively 40 seconds. The software
watchdog is only enabled if it sees a typical linux
hearbeat pattern repeat itself four times. The reason
for this is to prevent rebooting the board if the
system takes a long time to boot for unknown reasons.
The downside of this of course being that if the
OS does not boot, then no reboot occurs (which is
an acceptable behavior considering that if it doesn't
boot, then it probably also wouldn't boot after a reset).
U8 reboots the system by depressing the PMIC button for
seven seconds causing the power to be shut-off and then
turned on again. IE: The watchdoc performs a cold reboot).
